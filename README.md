# nslogin-web #

nslogin-web is a free and open source web application that allows you to
automatically log into and semi-automatically restore NationStates nations.
This is useful to maintain a large number of puppet nations by preventing them
from ceasing to exist or easily restoring them if they have ceased to exist.

The latest version of nslogin-web can be accessed [here](https://auralia.github.io/nslogin-web/build).
