goldretriever-web is a free and open source web application that allows you to

from ceasing to exist or easily restoring them if they have ceased to exist.

goldretriever-web features the following:

* ability to login and restore nations, and to automatically determine which
  is necessary
* progress reporting
* rate-limiting
* ability to save configuration
